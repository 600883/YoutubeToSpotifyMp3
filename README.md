# YoutubeToSpotifyMp3
Python script that converts YouTube links to mp3 files and stores it in local folder in Spotify

# Why this project?
It makes it easier for everyone to listen to songs that you cant find on Spotify.

# Still some issues
Spotify is not able to show the local file folder that i specified. It is probably some bugs in the app

## Still working on this project to optimize it, so that it automatically makes a folder and shows it in the local folder on Spotify
